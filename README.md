# MR(A)I workshop

Code and data for the summer MR(A)I workshop.

The exercises for this workshop are organized into Jupyter Notebooks which is a way of serving executable Python code on
a web page. A Jupyter server can be run by through the internet using Google's Colaboratory service. 

## Getting Started With Colaboratory

We will be using Google Colaboratory to run our notebooks when doing training since a GPU is basically required. You can
run the other notebooks locally but everything can be done through Colab if desired.

To get going with Colab:
1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com (be sure to be logged into your Google account beforehand)
2. Click on the Github tab and enter https://github.com/Warvito/MRAI_workshop_tensorflow/ into the search box
3. A number of notebooks should appear, double click the one to load
4. When the notebook loads we want to switch to using a GPU supported environment, so in the menu go to "Runtime" and
then "Change runtime type". 
5. Choose GPU under hardware accelerator and then click Save.
6. You can start using the notebooks by clicking on the run icons to the left of each cell or press ctrl+Enter. (You will
get popups about the notebook not being authored by Google and other things, just click Yes to these)
